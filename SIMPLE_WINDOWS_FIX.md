# Simple Windows Fix

## Quick Solution

### 1. Stop Everything
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop your development server
- Close all terminals and editors
- Wait 10 seconds

### 2. Run This Command
```bash
node scripts/windows-safe-prisma-fix.js
```

### 3. If That Fails, Try This
```bash
# Close everything first, then:
rmdir /s /q node_modules
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

### 4. If Still Failing
```bash
# Nuclear option - restart computer, then:
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

## What's Happening
Windows is locking the Prisma client files because:
- Your dev server is still running
- VS Code has files open
- Windows hasn't released file handles

The safe fix script handles this with retries and proper cleanup.
