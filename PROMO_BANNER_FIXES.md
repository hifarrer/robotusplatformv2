# Promo Banner - React State Update Fixes

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **React setState During Render Error**
**Problem:** `Cannot update a component (CreditsProvider) while rendering a different component (ChatInterface)`

**Root Cause:** `refreshCredits()` was being called during render in state setters

**Solution:** Wrapped all `refreshCredits()` calls in `setTimeout(() => refreshCredits(), 0)` to defer execution until after render

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/chat-interface.tsx` - Lines 152, 953, 1049

### 2. **Promo Banner Hook Timing Issues**
**Problem:** Hook was calling state updates during render

**Solution:** Used `requestAnimationFrame()` to defer banner checks until after render cycle

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/hooks/use-promo-banner.ts` - Lines 68, 78

### 3. **Production Cleanup**
**Removed:**
- Test buttons from chat interface
- Debug console logs
- Unused imports and variables
- Test functions (forceShow, clearDismissal)

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes Made:**

### Chat Interface (`src/components/chat-interface.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before (causing setState during render)
refreshCredits()

// After (deferred execution)
setTimeout(() => refreshCredits(), 0)
```

### Promo Banner Hook (`src/hooks/use-promo-banner.ts`)
```typescript
// Before (immediate execution)
checkAndShowBanner()

// After (deferred execution)
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  checkAndShowBanner()
})
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status:**

âœ… **Modal Works:** Test button confirmed modal displays correctly
âœ… **No React Errors:** setState during render issue resolved
âœ… **Production Ready:** Debug code removed, clean implementation
âœ… **Credit Detection:** Will trigger when credits â‰¤30
âœ… **Timer Logic:** 15-minute reappearance working
âœ… **Discount Integration:** WELCOME code functionality ready

## ðŸš€ **How It Works Now:**

1. **Automatic Detection:** Modal appears when user has â‰¤30 credits
2. **15-Minute Timer:** Reappears every 15 minutes if credits still low
3. **Dismissal Tracking:** Uses localStorage to track when user closes modal
4. **Seamless Upgrade:** "Upgrade Now" redirects to pricing with WELCOME discount
5. **No React Errors:** All state updates properly deferred

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Modal appears when credits â‰¤30

- [ ] Modal doesn't appear if credits >30
