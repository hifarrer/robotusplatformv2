- Seeds all three plans into database
- Assigns all existing users to Free plan
- Sets initial credit balance to 120
- Can be run with: `npm run seed:plans`

**Execution Results:**
```

✓ Basic plan created/updated
✓ Premium plan created/updated
✓ Assigned Free plan to user: test@gmail.com
✓ Assigned Free plan to user: vanedades@hotmail.com
```

### 8. UI Components

- Shows current plan details
- Lists all credit costs
- Provides upgrade options
- Responsive dialog interface with animations

### 9. Type Definitions

Updated `src/types/index.ts` with:
- `Plan` interface
- `CreditTransaction` interface
- `TransactionType` type
- Updated `User` interface with credits and plan

### 10. Documentation

**`CREDITS_SYSTEM.md`**
- Complete documentation of credit system
- API endpoints documentation
- Database schema details
- Credit management functions
- Error handling guidelines
- Future enhancement ideas

## 📊 Database Changes

### New Tables Created
1. **Plan** - Stores pricing tier information
2. **CreditTransaction** - Transaction history and audit trail

### Modified Tables
1. **User** - Added `credits` (Int, default: 120) and `planId` (String, optional)

### All Existing Users
- ✅ Assigned to Free plan
- ✅ Credited with 60 initial credits

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Credit Deduction Flow
1. User initiates generation request
2. System calculates credit cost based on type and duration
3. Check if user has sufficient credits
4. If insufficient, return 402 error with cost details
5. If sufficient, deduct credits atomically using Prisma transaction
6. Record transaction in CreditTransaction table
7. Proceed with generation
8. On failure, refund credits automatically

### Error Handling
- **402 Payment Required**: Insufficient credits
- Includes required credit amount in error response
- User-friendly error messages in chat responses
- Automatic refunds on generation failures

### Transaction Logging
Every credit operation is logged with:
- Amount (negative for deductions, positive for additions)
- New balance after operation
- Transaction type (DEBIT, CREDIT, REFUND, PURCHASE)
- Generation type (if applicable)
- Description
- Metadata (additional context)
- Timestamp

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Start Using the System
1. Restart the dev server (to load new Prisma client)
2. Import and use `<CreditsDisplay />` component in your layout
3. Users will automatically see credit deductions during generations
4. Insufficient credit errors will be displayed with upgrade prompts

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Implement actual payment processing (Stripe integration)
- [ ] Add credit purchase without plan upgrade
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for plan management
- [ ] Add usage analytics and reporting
- [ ] Implement credit expiration dates
- [ ] Add promotional credit campaigns
- [ ] Create referral credit system

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Prisma Client Generation**: Windows file lock issue when dev server is running
   - **Solution**: Restart the dev server, Prisma client will regenerate automatically
   - Database schema is already updated successfully

## 📝 Package.json Updates

Added new script:
```json
"seed:plans": "tsx scripts/seed-plans.ts"
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Automatic credit deduction before generation
- ✅ Transparent credit cost display to users
- ✅ Transaction history for audit trail
- ✅ Automatic refunds on generation failures
- ✅ Atomic transactions (no race conditions)
- ✅ Multiple billing cycles (monthly/yearly)
- ✅ Easy plan upgrades
- ✅ Credit balance checks
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 💡 Usage Example

```typescript
// In any generation endpoint
const creditResult = await checkAndDeductCreditsForGeneration(
  userId,
  'TEXT_TO_IMAGE'
)

if (!creditResult.success) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { 
      error: creditResult.error,
      required: creditResult.cost 
    },
    { status: 402 }
  )
}

// Proceed with generation...
```

## 🔄 Migration Status

- ✅ Database schema migrated
- ✅ All users migrated to Free plan
- ✅ All generation endpoints updated
- ✅ Credit checking implemented
- ✅ Transaction logging active
- ✅ API endpoints created
- ✅ UI components ready
- ✅ Documentation complete

## 📌 Important Notes

1. All current users have been assigned to the Free plan with 60 credits
2. Credit costs are calculated automatically based on generation type and duration
3. Failed generations automatically trigger credit refunds
4. All credit operations use database transactions for consistency
5. Credit balance is checked before ANY generation starts
6. 402 status code is used for insufficient credits (standard HTTP code for payment required)
