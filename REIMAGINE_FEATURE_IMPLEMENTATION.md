# ReImagine Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a new **ReImagine** feature that allows users to reimagine/recreate existing images using the WAVESPEED.ai Soul model (`higgsfield/soul/image-to-image`).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Type System Updates
- **File**: `src/types/index.ts`
- Added `IMAGE_REIMAGINE` to `GenerationType`
- Added `WavespeedReimagineRequest` interface for the API request
- Updated `AIAnalysisResult` to include `image_reimagine` action

### 2. AI Service Integration
- **File**: `src/lib/ai-services.ts`
- Added `reimagineImage()` method to `WavespeedService`
- Configured to call `https://api.wavespeed.ai/api/v3/higgsfield/soul/image-to-image`
- Parameters:
  - `image`: The URL of the image to reimagine
  - `prompt`: Always set to "reimagine this picture"
  - `quality`: "medium"
  - `size`: "1152*1536"
  - `strength`: 0.5
  - `style`: "Realistic"

### 3. Credit System
- **File**: `src/lib/credit-costs.ts`
- Added `IMAGE_REIMAGINE` cost: **6 credits per image**
- Updated cost calculation and description functions

### 4. API Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/reimagine-image/route.ts`
- Created new POST endpoint: `/api/reimagine-image`
- Handles:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Credit checking and deduction
  - Image reimagining via WAVESPEED.ai
  - Result polling (up to 4 minutes)
  - Automatic image saving to user's library
  - Credit refund on failure
- Response includes:
  - `success`: Boolean
  - `generationId`: The generation record ID
  - `imageUrl`: URL of the reimagined image
  - `savedImageId`: ID of the saved image
  - `creditsUsed`: Credits deducted
  - `creditsRemaining`: User's remaining credits

### 5. User Interface
- **File**: `src/components/my-images-view.tsx`
- Added **ReImagine button** with Sparkles icon
- Button appears in two locations:
  1. **Hover overlay** on image cards in the grid
  2. **Action buttons** in the image detail modal
- Features:
  - Loading state with spinning icon
  - Purple color theme for the button
  - Success/error notifications
  - Automatic image list refresh after completion

### 6. AI Orchestrator Integration
- **File**: `src/lib/ai-orchestrator.ts`
- Updated system prompt to include `image_reimagine` action
- Added keyword detection:
  - "reimagine"
  - "recreate"
  - "new version"
  - "different version"
  - "variations"
  - "rethink"
  - "reinvent"
- Added fallback logic for reimagine requests
- Validates that an image is present before processing

### 7. Database Schema
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `IMAGE_REIMAGINE` to `GenerationType` enum
- Successfully pushed to production database using `prisma db push`

## Usage

### From the My Images Page:
1. Navigate to `/my-images`
2. Hover over any image in the grid
3. Click the **Sparkles icon** (ReImagine button)
4. The image will be processed and a new reimagined version will be added to your library
5. The operation costs **6 credits**

### From the Chat Interface:
Users can also request reimagining through chat by:
- Uploading an image and saying "reimagine this"
- Referencing a recent image and saying "recreate that image"
- Using any of the reimagine keywords

## Technical Notes

### API Request Format
```javascript
POST /api/reimagine-image
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "chatId": "optional-chat-id"
}
```

Note: The API automatically creates a message and chat if needed, so you don't need to provide a messageId.

### WAVESPEED.ai Request Format
```javascript
POST https://api.wavespeed.ai/api/v3/higgsfield/soul/image-to-image
Authorization: Bearer ${WAVESPEED_API_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "image": "{image_url}",
  "prompt": "reimagine this picture",
  "quality": "medium",
  "size": "1152*1536",
  "strength": 0.5,
  "style": "Realistic"
}
```

### Result Polling
- Uses the same `WavespeedService.getResult()` method as other operations
- Polls every 2 seconds for up to 4 minutes (120 attempts)
- Checks for `status === 'completed'` in the response (same as all other Wavespeed endpoints)

## Cost Structure
- **IMAGE_REIMAGINE**: 6 credits per image
- Cost is deducted upfront
- Automatically refunded if the operation fails

## Error Handling
- Authentication errors return 401
- Insufficient credits return 402 with required amount
- Processing errors return 500
- All errors include descriptive messages
- Credits are automatically refunded on failure

## Files Modified
1. `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions
2. `src/lib/ai-services.ts` - Service implementation
3. `src/lib/credit-costs.ts` - Credit cost configuration
4. `src/lib/ai-orchestrator.ts` - AI request analysis
5. `src/components/my-images-view.tsx` - UI implementation
6. `src/app/api/reimagine-image/route.ts` - API endpoint (new file)
7. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema

## Next Steps (If Needed)

### Restart Development Server
If you encounter any TypeScript errors related to the new `IMAGE_REIMAGINE` type:
1. Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Run `npm run dev` again
4. This will allow Prisma to regenerate the client with the new types

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test reimagine from My Images page (hover button)
- [ ] Test reimagine from image detail modal
- [ ] Test reimagine via chat with uploaded image
- [ ] Test reimagine via chat with reference to recent image
- [ ] Verify credits are deducted correctly (6 credits)
- [ ] Verify credits are refunded on failure
- [ ] Verify reimagined images are saved to library
- [ ] Verify image list refreshes after reimagining
- [ ] Test error handling (insufficient credits, API errors)
