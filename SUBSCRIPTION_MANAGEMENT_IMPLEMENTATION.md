# Subscription Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented subscription management features for users on paid plans, allowing them to cancel, upgrade, or downgrade their subscriptions directly from the pricing page.

## Features Implemented

- **POST**: Cancels subscription at the end of the current billing period
- **GET**: Retrieves subscription status and cancellation information
- Validates user authentication and plan status
- Uses Stripe API to manage subscription cancellation

#### `/api/change-subscription`
- **POST**: Handles subscription changes (upgrades/downgrades)
- Supports immediate plan changes for existing subscriptions
- Creates new checkout sessions for users without active subscriptions
- Handles downgrade to Free plan with proper subscription cancellation

#### `/api/customer-portal`

## Technical Details

### TypeScript Issue Resolution
Fixed TypeScript compilation error with Stripe subscription types by using type casting:
```typescript
currentPeriodEnd: (subscription as any).current_period_end,
cancelAtPeriodEnd: (subscription as any).cancel_at_period_end,
cancelAt: (subscription as any).canceled_at,
```

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper validation at API level
- Loading states during async operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Security
- All endpoints require authentication via NextAuth
- User validation before any subscription changes
- Stripe customer ID verification
- Secure token handling for customer portal sessions

## User Experience

### For Free Plan Users
- Standard pricing page with subscription options
- Clear call-to-action buttons to upgrade
- No subscription management section visible

### For Paid Plan Users
- Dedicated subscription management section at top of pricing page
- Clear visibility of subscription status
- Easy access to billing management
- Simple cancellation process with clear consequences
- Ability to change plans with visual feedback

## Integration with Existing System

The implementation works seamlessly with existing webhook handlers:
- `checkout.session.completed`: Handles new subscriptions
- `customer.subscription.updated`: Handles plan changes
- `customer.subscription.deleted`: Handles cancellations
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`: Handles recurring payments

### Database Updates
- User plan updates handled by webhook events
- Credit allocation maintained through existing credit manager
- Transaction history preserved
